        <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
        <p>Dear Tanu,</p>
        <p>I've been rude, and I want to sincerely apologize for my actions. I deeply regret how I made you feel, and I want to make things right. I don't want to lose you. The only thing I want to lose is weight. I have not treated you right. But I promise you that I will make everything right. And yes these are really not empty words. You really mean a lot to me. I may be lacking a bit for the past few weeks. Sorry for making you feel like shit.</p>
        <p>You're incredibly important to me, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. ðŸ’–</p>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to do this scavenger hunt. I hope this small gesture conveys how much I care about you. I promise to always try my best to be a better partner for you.</p>
            <p>With love, Amogh</p>
